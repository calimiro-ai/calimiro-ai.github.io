        <h2>A powerful smart mirror to film and track your workout sessions with AI.</h2>
        
        <p> Built in Munich, Germany, by Lennard Gross, Philip Synowiec und Younes Bendimerad at <a href="https://www.check24.de">CHECK24</a></p>

        <h3>Our goal</h3>
        

        <p>
        Calimiro AI develops a smart mirror, which is able to track your workout session and to recognize the workout exercise you're doing.
        It can also count repetitions, and so establish reliable statistics about your global performance.
        We want to make fitness and calisthenics easier for people who are starting in this discipline, without
        forcing them to be in the gym or to have a coach.
        </p>

        <h3>Project overview</h3>
        
        <p>
        A Calimiro consists of several components. A Raspberry Pi 4+, a transparent mirror 
        with integrated display, and an ESP Camera. A webserver permits a WiFi connection between the 
        Raspberry Pi and the Camera to establish an HTTP (or on newer versions RTSP) live video stream. 
        The core of Calimiro, Calitracker, runs on the Raspberry Pi and analyzes your position with several 
        pre-trained AI models. Another server runs on the Raspberry Pi to permit communication with the 
        User Interface, built with MagicMirror. Since september 2025, we've also been building a mobile app so that
        the users can run Calimiro on their phone!
